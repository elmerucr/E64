# E64

![E64](./docs/E64_icon_156x156.png)

## General Description

E64 is a Virtual Computer System that runs on macOS and linux. Technical specifications are heavily inspired by the Commodore 64, Amiga 500 and Atari ST. The programming model is very comparable to fantasy consoles such as TIC-80 and PICO-8.

* The core is a Lua scripting engine
* BLITTER/VIDEO chip with a resolution of 384x216 pixels, a palette of 4096 colors (12bit) running at 60Hz, alpha blending capabilities and 16mb video ram.
* Sound:
	* Four SID chips (MOS 6581). Each individual SID chip runs at 985248Hz for the same pitch as the chips in the original C64 pal version. Emulation is achieved with the excellent [reSID](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/crossplatform/emulators/resid/index.html) library by Dag Lem. Registers are remapped to enable big endian systems.
	* Four Analog Sound Devices capable of pure sinusoidal sound next to all common other sound waves.
	* Stereo mixing capabilities for all components.

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts

* ```ALT```+```Q``` quits application
* ```ALT```+```W``` start/stop wav file output to settings directory
* ```ALT```+```B``` switches between nearest pixel and bilinear filtering mode
* ```ALT```+```S``` changes intensity of embedded scanlines
* ```ALT```+```F``` switches between fullscreen and window(debug mode)
* ```F10``` switches stats on/off

## Technical Specifications

* ```0x600000-0x7fffff``` blitter background color RAM (2mb)
* ```0x800000-0xffffff``` blitter pixel RAM (8mb)

## Compiling

### macOS

* Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
* Install the [SDL2 framework](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) development library to /Library/Frameworks
* Open the Xcode project in the ./E64 folder and build the application

### Ubuntu Linux / Debian

Run the following commands in a terminal to make a debug build:

````console
$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libsdl2-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/elmerucr/E64
$ cd E64 && mkdir Debug && cd Debug
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
$ make
````

Finally, to run the application from the build directory:

````console
$ ./E64
````
